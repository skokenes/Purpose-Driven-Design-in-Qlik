# Purpose Driven Design in QlikView and Qlik Sense

At the Qlik World Conference 2014, I gave a presentation on building dashboards and visualizations with purpose-driven design decisions in QlikView and Qlik Sense. I've uploaded my presentation slides as a PDF to this repository, as well as code samples for all of the Qlik Sense extensions and mashups demonstrated.

You can view live examples of the Sense materials as well:

  - [Strip Plot]
  - [Forecasting]
  - [Animated Bar Chart]

  > Note: The source application for the Forecasting example is not available in this repository at this time.
